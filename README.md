   Hello I'm Merve
   I am a front-end React developer and Math Teacher.
   I may have just started the process, but I am a fast learner and I like to finish the things I start with success.
   I take advantage of being a mother and being a teacher. Being able to focus on many things at the same time and using time correctly and efficiently are among my abilities.
